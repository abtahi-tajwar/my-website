      "Hi, I’m Abtahi — a full-stack developer and problem solver who thrives at the intersection of clean design, scalable systems, and secure engineering practices. Over the past few years, I’ve built and led projects ranging from multi-tenant retail platforms to intuitive productivity tools, using technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Laravel. My approach to development is hands-on and iterative: I believe in building fast, learning from real users, and refining until the experience feels effortless.",
      "I’ve worked on high-impact projects, including government-sponsored initiatives and enterprise-grade web platforms, where both performance and reliability were critical. I enjoy architecting solutions that not only solve immediate needs but can also evolve gracefully as businesses scale. Beyond my technical focus, I bring strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset, making me comfortable leading teams as well as diving deep into solo problem-solving.",
      "Currently based in Canada, I’m also expanding into cybersecurity and research, with a vision to combine robust development practices with secure-by-default design. For me, building software isn’t just about shipping features — it’s about creating systems that are dependable, usable, and trusted."
